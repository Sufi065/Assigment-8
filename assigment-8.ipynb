    " ans:-Abstraction in OOP refers to the concept of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within a program. It involves hiding unnecessary details and focusing on essential features to provide a high-level view. Abstraction allows developers to build more manageable and modular systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    " consider a class called `Shape` that represents geometric shapes.\n",
    " \n",
    "The `Shape` class can have a method called `calculate_area()` which calculates the area of the shape.\n",
    "\n",
    " The implementation of the `calculate_area()` method would vary for different shapes such as rectangles, circles, or triangles.\n",
    " \n",
    "  By using abstraction, we can define the `calculate_area()` method in the `Shape` class without specifying its implementation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   Each specific shape class (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle`) would inherit from the `Shape` class and provide its own implementation of the `calculate_area()` method. The abstraction allows us to work with shapes in a unified manner without worrying about the internal details of each shape.\n"
